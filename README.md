A short overview of things I use:

- fzf: fuzzy finder. useful for searching for files etc
- git: version control software
- i3status: a status bar for 3 window manager. it's compatible with Sway.

- sway: window manager for wayland
- vim/neovim: my primary text editor
- waybar: highly customizable status bar for wayland

### Thees

I don't have one theme that I use everywhere. I have a set of favorite theme
through which I keep cycling. Following are a few of them:

- Vim/Neovim: Gruvbox(using now), Palenight, OceanicNext
- Alacritty: Palenight, Purify
- Zsh: flazz, agnoster
